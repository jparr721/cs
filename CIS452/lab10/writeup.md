1. The total amount of available memory is `4gb` and the memory in use is `1.6gb`.
2. After launching reddit, netflix, and the weather channel, the memory usage went up to about `2.3db`. As a result, it is clear that, while heavily optimized for windows, Edge still has to eat some of the system ram in order to run complex web data. It's far less than the memory consumed by google chrome, however. The memory demand it about `.7gb`.

5. Total physical memory is `4gb` and tht eottal virtual memory is `5.37gb`. This is because there is a larger amount of virtual memory as a result of disk space almost always being larger than onboard memory. As a result, there is more available harddrive space to be used for virtual memory.
6. This value is `1408mb` and is used as an extension of RAM for data in RAM that has not been used recently. This is used to speed up reading data from the hard disk. This is similar to the linux swap file or swap partition, which does a similar utility of swapping idle processes out of RAM temporarily. This value of `1408mb` corresponds to the virtual memory size of `~5.4gb` because this is calculated as the total RAM + the pagefile size.
7. After using `RamMap.exe` it was seen that the `explorer.exe` program is `1484K`.
